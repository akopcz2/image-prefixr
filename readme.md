Simple image pre-fixer if your project requires you to rename images.
Run this to rename all your images instead of doing this in image editing software like photoshop.

Change the following vars

imagesFolder --> To the folder where your images are
imageDirectory --> To the directory where your images are
prefix -- > To the appropriate prefix
